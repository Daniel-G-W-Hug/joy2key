Code for di8joy copied from the joystick part of the SFML library (V 2.5.1)
and adjusted to my specific needs.

All credits for the original implementation go to the original authors.

My modifications vs. SFML V2.5.1 are:

- Axis enumeration changed to (X,Y,Z,Rx,Ry,Rz,S0,S1) vs. (X,Y,Z,R,U,V,PovX,PovY)
- 128 virtual buttons supported for all joysticks (vs. 32)
- POV hats are not mapped to an axis but provided as separate output (vs. 1 POV mapped to slider axes)
- use std::wstring instead of sf::String
- requires direct input 8 (fallback mode removed); 
  the implementation is for the windows platform (WIN32) exclusively


under consideration:
  - POV hats are additionally mapped to virtual buttons instead of to a virtual axis
  (above physical buttons as long as free virtual buttons are still available)
